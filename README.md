# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
Louise is working on a campaign for her play and the following thread are few supporting analysis with the data provided to help Louise run a succefull play. The data collected is from past crowd funding projects. Below we will go in detail with the results, analysis and conclusion. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this exercise is to help Louise with her crowdfunding campaign. We will be using various types of tables and charts to help Louise optimize her project. The excel sheet attached to this project can be used as reference to provide breakdowns of the chart in the coming sections.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Overview of analysis
We have ran the analysis with previous data based on three key project outcomes (Successful, Failed and Cancelled). It was interesting to see that the succesfull rate increases through first few month of the year and peaking in the month of May. The rate takes a turn going through summer season and with the least successful being in december. We are unable to return any relation for failed and cancelled theater projects and it seemed to have no relation with the month they're operating in.  

#### Outcome of Theater Campaigns Based on Launch Date

#### Outcome of Campaigns related to Plays Based on Goals

Another analysis was completed on the outcomes based on funding goal. The conclusion was that lower funding experienced a higher successful percentage outcome and lower failed percentage outcome. On the contrary, higher funding projects had high failes rate and low successful rate.

### Challenges and/or difficulties
Writing the analysis was at first challenging but when I progressed the document it got easier once the activites are broken down. This assigment was also my first on Github and that was also challenging but I managed to follow the guidance and complete the updates. 

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? The first few month of the year shows a steady incline for launch date and then we have a steep decline going through all the way into december.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? The lower the funding goal the higher percentage for successful campaign. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset? Adding additional field might provide more detailed analysis. For example linking the outcome to  weather condition for each outcome might provide better models. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? Comparing the outcomes for different catogories in relation to countries.
